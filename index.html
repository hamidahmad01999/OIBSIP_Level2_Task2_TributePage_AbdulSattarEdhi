                        <h2>How Edhi Foundation Started??</h2>
                        <p>Edhi resolved to dedicate his life to aiding the poor, and over the next sixty years, he single-handedly changed the face of welfare in Pakistan.[24] He subsequently founded the Edhi Foundation. Edhi was known for his ascetic lifestyle,
                            owning only two pairs of clothes, never taking salary from his organization and living in a small apartment next to his organization's office.Additionally, his previously established welfare trust, named the Edhi Trust was
                            restarted with an initial sum of Rs.5000, the trust was later renamed after his wife as the Bilquis Edhi Trust.Widely regarded and respected as a guardian and savior for the poor, Edhi began receiving numerous donations which
                            allowed him to expand his services.
                            <details>As of 2016, the Edhi Foundation continues to grow in both size and service and currently remains the largest welfare organization in Pakistan. Since its inception, the Edhi Foundation has rescued over 20,000 abandoned infants,
                                rehabilitated over 50,000 orphans and has trained over 40,000 nurses.It also runs more than 330 welfare centres throughout rural and urban Pakistan that operate as food kitchens, rehabilitation homes, shelters for abandoned
                                women and children, and clinics for the mentally and physically handicapped. <a href="">See more</a></details>
